Problem Statement:

Design and develop an Eye-Controlled Virtual Mouse to empower 

individuals with mobility impairments or disabilities, enabling hands-free 

computer interaction through eye movement and blink detection. This 

system should utilize a webcam to track facial and eye movements, 

translating these into cursor movements, clicks, and other actions, making 

computers more accessible and enhancing the digital experience for 

people with limited hand mobility.

This solution will provide a reliable, empowering tool that enhances 

computer accessibility for individuals with disabilities, fostering greater 

independence and engagement with digital devices.
